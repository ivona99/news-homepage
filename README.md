- CSS Grid
- JavaScript, DOM manipulation


<!-- ### What I learned


Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
``` -->


### Continued development

This is my first challange on Frontendmentor, so I think I have more space for improvement, but I also know I have a lot things to learn and practice more. 

I want to practice more how to make page responsive, and compliting tasks using only JavaScript. Learning and understanding logic beyond it, because I think it would help me to solve more advantage tasks by myself. I also want to learn how to write 
less but more or at least same efficient code. And at the end use some framework to complete same tasks or some other maby more complicated tasks and challenges.
